# Welcome to Dynamic Paintbrush!

This is my Capstone project at DevCodeCamp.

This is a full stack platform for interactive graphic novels platform for artists to make and share interactive graphic novels. This is a asp.net backend with react.js front end, and has features such as profile page, reviews, comments, and donations button using Stripes API.

The artist can upload images, and then put them together into interactive graphic novels in the workstation.

The workstation lets the artists add panels, and then specify actions that should take place at certain times.

The data is then saved to database, and readers can enjoy these.
